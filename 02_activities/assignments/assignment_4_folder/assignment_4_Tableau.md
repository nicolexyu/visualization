# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
- For each visualization, describe and justify: 

    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?

    Tableau Public was utilized to create the interactive dashboard available at the link: 

    https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/n.y8309/viz/DashboardShort-TermRental/DashboardShort-TermRental?publish=yes


    > Who is your intended audience? 

    - Researchers and analysts studying the distribution and types of short-term rentals.
    - Community members seeking transparency in rental property statistics.
    - Real estate professionals interested in market trends for short-term rentals.

    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 

    - The distribution of property types used for short-term rentals.
    - Wards with the highest and lowest numbers of short-term rental properties.
    - How property types are distributed across wards.
    - These insights reveal key trends in rental housing and provide a basis for understanding geographic and property-type preferences.

    
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 

    - Substantive Principles: Focused on key dimensions (e.g., ward, property type) to maintain relevance and align with stakeholder needs.

    - Perceptual Principles: Interactive filters and tooltips make complex data accessible to diverse audiences.

    - Aesthetic Principles: Utilized a professional color scheme that aligns with Tableau's default palettes but is adjusted for accessibility (e.g., avoiding colors that are hard to differentiate for color-blind users).

    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 

    Tableau: The dashboard is published on Tableau Public, ensuring accessibility and transparency, though it is less directly reproducible compared to Python code.
    

    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  

    Tableau Dashboard: Interactive features allow users to explore the data by property type and ward, accommodating varying interests and analytical needs.

    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  

    Positively Impacted:
    - Policy-makers and planners can use the insights for housing regulations and planning.
    - Community members gain transparency in local housing trends.

    Potentially Negatively Impacted:
    - Property owners in wards with high concentrations of rentals may face increased scrutiny or regulation.
    
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 

    Included Features:

    - Property Type and Ward: Key variables that provide a detailed understanding of the geographic and categorical distribution of short-term rentals.
    - Filters: Added to enable users to explore the data dynamically.

    Excluded Features:

    - Unit Numbers: Excluded for the same reasons as in Python, as they were not relevant to the visualizations or analysis.

    
    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?

    Data Preparation for Tableau:

    - Exported a cleaned and aggregated dataset compatible with Tableau, ensuring proper column formats and no missing critical values.

    Dashboard Design:

    - Experimented with multiple layouts to ensure the visualizations were user-friendly and intuitive.
    
    - Set up filters for interactivity and tested their functionality to ensure no errors.

    Color and Accessibility Optimization:

    - Customized Tableauâ€™s color palettes for readability and accessibility, accounting for potential color blindness.

    Testing and Iteration:

    - Tested the dashboard in Tableau Public to ensure performance and functionality for public viewing.

    1. Cleaning the data in Python Before Tableau.

    - Preprocessing Complexity: Python allows for more complex cleaning operations (e.g., filtering out anomalies or imputing missing values) that might be difficult to implement directly in Tableau.
    - Ensures Consistency: Cleaning in Python ensures the dataset imported into Tableau is reliable, avoiding issues during visualization.
    - Reproducibility: Python code is reusable and ensures the cleaning steps are documented and repeatable.

    2. Loading the Clean Data into Tableau (file name: short-term-rentals-cleaned_data.csv)

    3. Findings

    Short-Term Rentals by Property Type

    Condos are a popular choice for short-term rentals in Toronto, with many listings found in downtown and central areasâ€‹. 3282 condominiums are listed in Toronto. However, some condominiums may have additional rules that limit or prohibit short-term rentals based on their own bylaw. In addition, there are 3743 single-semi detached houses listed for short-term rental in Toronto. These homes are also popular for short-term stays, often providing more space and privacy than condos. For entire house rentals, the city allows up to 180 nights of rental per year, with specific rules for registration and operationâ€‹.

    Short-Term Rentals by Ward

    Spadinaâ€”Fort York, located in Toronto, is a popular ward that encompasses diverse neighborhoods, including those close to the waterfront and downtown areas. As a prime location, this ward sees a high concentration of short-term rental properties, with reports indicating that there are around 2,457 short-term rental listings in the area.

    In Spadinaâ€”Fort York, approximately 2,068 of the 2,457 short-term rental properties are condominiums. This highlights the area's popularity for condo-based rentals, which is consistent with the high density and demand for short-term accommodations in central Toronto. Condos are particularly sought after due to their proximity to downtown amenities, tourist attractions, and convenient public transit options

    The Davenport ward in Toronto has the highest number of single-family detached properties among the city's wards, with approximately 359 properties (total properties for short-term rental). This is significant in the context of Toronto's real estate landscape, as single-family detached homes are often in high demand due to their space, privacy, and typically larger lots compared to other property types, such as condominiums or townhouses.
